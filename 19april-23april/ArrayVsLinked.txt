Q.In which scenario do you use Linkedlist and Arraylist?
Ans:LinkedList should be used where modifications to a collection are frequent like addition/deletion operations.
    LinkedList is much faster as compare to ArrayList in such cases.
    In case of read-only collections or collections which are rarely modified, ArrayList is suitable.
    
    ArrayList provides constant time for search operation, 
    so it is better to use ArrayList if searching is more frequent operation than add and remove operation. 
    The LinkedList provides constant time for add and remove operations. So it is better to use LinkedList for manipulation.

    ArrayList has O(1) time complexity to access elements via the get and set methods.

    LinkedList has O(n/2) time complexity to access the elements.

    LinkedLinked class implements Deque interface also, so you can get the functionality of double ended queue in LinkedList.
    The ArrayList class doesn't implement Deque interface.
    
    In sort, ArrayList is better to access data wherease LinkedList is better to manipulate data. Both classes implements List interface.
