class Base {
    public Base() {
        System.out.print("Base ");
    }

    public Base(String s) {
        System.out.print("Base: " + s);
    }
}

class Derived extends Base {
    public Derived(String s) {
        super(); // Stmt-1
        super(s); // Stmt-2
        System.out.print("Derived ");
    }
}

class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Base base = new Derived("Hello ");

Select three correct options from the following list:
a) Removing Stmt-1 will make the program compilable and it will print the following: Base Derived.
b) Removing Stmt-1 will make the program compilable and it will print the following: Base: Hello Derived.
c) Removing Stmt-2 will make the program compilable and it will print the following: Base Derived.
d) Removing both Stmt-1 and Stmt-2 will make the program compilable and it will print the following: Base Derived.
e) Removing both Stmt-1 and Stmt-2 will make the program compilable and it will print the following: Base: Hello Derived.

Answer-b,c,d
