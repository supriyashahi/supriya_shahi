package pack1;
 
class A
{
    public A()
    {
          //public constructor
    }
}
 
package pack2;
 
import pack1.*;
 
class B
{
     A a = new A();	//Compile Time Error
}


Check if compile time error exists. If yes, correct the code to remove the error?

Answer: Class-A itself has been defined with default access modifier. 
That means Class-A can be instantiated within the package in which it is defined. 
It can not be instantiated outside the package, even though it has public constructor.
package pack1;
 
class A
{
    public A()
    {
         A a = new A(); //public constructor
    }
}
 
package pack2;
 
import pack1.*;
 
class B
{
     	//Compile Time Error
}
